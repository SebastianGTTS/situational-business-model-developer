    Explanation of the Situational Business Model Developer (SBMD)
  </h6>
  <p>
    The Situational Business Model Developer that allows the enaction of
    situation-specific Business Model Development Methods. It uses the Method
    Modeler together with the Feature Modeler to support the business modeler in
    the enaction. The business modeler is guided through the method in a kanban
    board and also sees the enacted method.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-0">
    Additionally, the Situational Business Model Developer redirects the
    business developer to the correct locations in the Feature Modeler to
    support the creation of different canvases, e.g., business model canvas and
    value proposition canvas.
