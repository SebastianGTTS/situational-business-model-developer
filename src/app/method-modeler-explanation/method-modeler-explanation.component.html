    Explanation of the BMDL Modeler
  </h6>
  <p>
    The BMDL Method Modeler is a tool to describe situation-specific Business
    Model Development Methods. Business Model Development Methods can be
    described by combining Method Patterns and inserting Method Building Blocks
    into them. Method Patterns and Method Building Blocks are constructed from
    Method Elements. Method Elements are Artifacts, Situational Factors,
    Stakeholders, Tools and Types. Types are special, as they are used to
    determine which Method Building Blocks or Method Patterns can be inserted
    into activities of Method Patterns.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-0">
    Additionally, Method Building Blocks allow to select abstract list types for
    input/output Artifacts, Stakeholders and Tools. The user can later decide
    when developing the Business Model Development Methods, which concrete
    Method Element to use, e.g. an expert selected the abstract list type Users
    for stakeholders and the business developer can choose whether these are
    Customers, Experts or Early Adopters. Furthermore, the tool allows to define
    that a user is later able to select multiple instances of an abstract list
    type, e.g., in the example above, Customers and Experts. It is also possible
    to select between different Groups of input artifacts, output artifacts and
    Stakeholders.

  <p class="mt-2">Information about the execution steps:</p>

  <ol class="mb-0">
    <li>
      <strong>Create Method Elements:</strong> In the first step, an expert has
      to create Method Elements that are later used to define Method Building
      Blocks and Method Patterns. Method Elements are Artifacts, Situational
      Factors, Stakeholders, Tools and Types. Every Method Element belongs to a
      list of other Method Elements to group them. Later, when creating Method
      Building Blocks or Method Patterns, it is possible to reference such an
      abstract list of Method Elements to allow the user to select a fitting
      concrete Method Element when defining the Business Model Development
      Method. Special Method Elements are Types and Situational Factors. Types
      are used to filter which Method Building Blocks and Method Patterns can be
      used together and Situational Factors are used to analyze whether the used
      Method Patterns and Method Building Blocks fit to the development context.
      Additionally, Situational Factors can define values. In this tool examples
      for Method Elements are already created.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Create Method Building Blocks:</strong> In the second step, an
      expert can create Method Building Blocks. Method Building Blocks consist
      of input and output artifacts, involved stakeholders and tools.
      Additionally, they have types and situational factors. Examples for Method
      Building Blocks are already defined in this tool.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Create Method Patterns:</strong> In the third step, the expert can
      create Method Patterns. They define the structure of the later Business
      Model Development Methods. Method Patterns have types. A special type is
      <i>initialisation</i> that defines that the pattern can be used as a
      starting point. Additionally, a Method Pattern defines activities. The
      expert can choose whether only Method Building Blocks or Method Building
      Blocks and Method Patterns can be inserted into a single activity when the
      Business Model Development Method is defined. Examples for Method Patterns
      are already included in this tool.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Create Business Model Development Methods</strong> In the last
      step, a business developer can create Business Model Development Methods.
      To do this, the business developer first has to choose a Method Pattern as
      a starting point. Then, it is possible to insert fitting Method Building
      Blocks or Method Patterns into the activities of the Method Pattern.
      Additionally, the business developer can use situational factors to define
      the development context. This context is checked against the internal
      situational factors of the used Method Patterns and Method Building Blocks
      and mismatches are reported. Furthermore, the business developer can
      select per Method Building Block how the Method Building Block should be
      used, e.g., the business developer can select from lists which tools to
      use if the Method Building Block was created with an abstract definition.
    </li>
